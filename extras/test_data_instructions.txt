INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE TEST DATA

The test_data_for_model.csv file contains:
1. All cart events from your original data (these are what you want predictions for)
2. A few view and purchase events to satisfy the model's encoding requirements

A column called 'for_prediction' has been added:
- for_prediction=1: These are cart events that you want predictions for
- for_prediction=0: These are just included to satisfy the model requirements

When running predictions with your Streamlit app:
1. First run the model on the entire dataset
2. Then filter the results to only show rows where for_prediction=1
   (e.g., add ".filter(col('for_prediction') == 1)" before getting your final results)

This approach ensures the model's encoding requirements are met while still giving you
predictions for just the cart events.
